# Coding Dojo Katas - Krafters Vigo

This repository contains the katas performed during the coding dojos at Krafters Vigo. Katas are implented in python with pytest. Each kata is organized into its own directory, which includes:

- A `README.md` file that provides an explanation of the kata.
- A `src` directory that contains the source code for the kata.
- A `tests` directory that includes the test cases for the kata.

The repository also includes a `requirements.txt` file at the root level, which lists the general dependencies needed for the katas. This structure ensures that each kata is self-contained with its documentation, implementation, and tests, while the root-level requirements file provides a centralized list of dependencies.
